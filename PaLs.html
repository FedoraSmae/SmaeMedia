<h2 class="main-title">About PaLs</h2>
  <p class="main-paragraph subheading">History</p>
  <p class="main-paragraph">PaLs is an online organisation established in 2016 by a group of people, at the time known as LapisArmy, to try and create a safe, friendly, and active social environment for people who liked to play video games. As the organisation developed the interests became universal, and people interested in a variety of topics were involved in the organisations development too.</p>
	<p class="main-paragraph">The organisation has been through many phases throughout the years, but it has always managed to maintain it's online communal presence. The organisations most notable phase was it's involvement in Micronationalism, where The PaLsian Federation was established. This phase is where the organisations iconic logo/flag came from, which is still in use today.</p>
