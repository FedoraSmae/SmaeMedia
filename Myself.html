<p class="main-paragraph subheading2">DofE</p>

<p class="main-paragraph">During school I was able to achieve my DofE Bronze, and DofE Silver awards.</p>

<p class="main-paragraph">DofE has helped me develop and improve a number of skills such as presenting, teamwork, and leadership. I was also able to volunteer at my local Cub Scout group, which allowed me to build my confidence, as well as develop skills in communication, leadership, and organisation.</p>

<p class="main-paragraph subheading2">Projects</p>

<p class="main-paragraph">For my media studies coursework I designed marketing for a film I came up with, I was able to develop, and practice my skills in Adobe Photoshop, and Microsoft Publisher, as well as website design.</p>

<p class="main-paragraph">For my Computer Science coursework, I programmed, designed, and developed a video game prototype using LUA with the LOVE2D framework. I was able to expand my skills with Python as well as learn the fundamentals of the programming language LUA. I was also able to learn about program design, and prototyping too.</p>

<p class="caption">GIF of my game</p>
</section>

<p class="main-paragraph">This website is a self motivated project, I wanted to have everything about myself accessible from one place. I also wanted to give website design a go without using simplistic website designers like Wix, and Weebly. I programmed, and designed this entire website myself using Adobe&#39;s Dreamweaver, with the help of other tools such as Adobe Photoshop.</p>

<p class="main-paragraph subheading2">Scouting</p>

<p class="main-paragraph">I was apart of the scouting organisation for 16 years, I have been able to participate in community events, such as the rememberance parades, and local festival. I have also been able to participate in camping trips, national and local, and achieve a number of scout badges, and awards. I have been able to develop many skills through scouts, and I was able to improve my confidence, communication, and teamwork skills.</p>

<p class="main-paragraph subheading2">Other things to note</p>

<p class="main-paragraph">Through school I was able to participate in the government&#39;s Cyber Discovery school program, I have also been able to do other cyber security related activities such as Immersive Labs.</p>

<p class="main-paragraph subheading">Hobbies and Interests</p>

<p class="main-paragraph">In my free time I enjoy watching films, mainly ones of the Sci-Fi, Adventure, and Animation genre. I also enjoy playing video games, specifically strategy games. And I like to experiment, and create things using software, such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Premier Pro, and Adobe Dreamweaver, which helped me construct this website.</p>

<p class="main-paragraph">I also have interests in politics, and the history of modern-day countries. In my free time I enjoy researching about these topics, and testing my knowledge about the subject. This interest has allowed me to learn all the countries of the world, along with their respected flags!</p>
